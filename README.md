## Data and code used for blog posts and other activities ##

In the files and folders here you will find *data and R code* for my various blog posts and other texts. The idea is that for the code file to be perfectly self-contained so that you can simply press "run" and get exactly the same results as I did in the post. 

Some code files will be linked, meaning that you first need to run one in order to successfully run the other. In that case I will note this in a comment in the file. Make sure that to have the latest version of R and the various R packages called in the beginning of the code.
